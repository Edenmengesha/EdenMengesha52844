### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- My name is Eden Mengesha , Student ID 52844
- I am from Ethiopia. 
- I have been in Poland for about 3 years now and i am grateful for all the people i have met and all the memories i have made in poland.
- As for the cultural difference i would say there are to many to get throgh here so i will skip that part 
- I defiantly do plan to follow a career path in the future with IT , maybe not in particular java but defiantly in the spectrum of IT
